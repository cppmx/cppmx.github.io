Big O notation is an essential tool for any programmer to understand and use. It's a way of measuring the complexity of algorithms, allowing us to compare different approaches to solving problems. Knowing how Big O works can help you write better code, making it more efficient and easier to maintain over time. 

At its core, Big O notation measures the worst-case scenario when running an algorithm or program – that is, how long it takes for the algorithm or program’s performance (or runtime) increases as input size grows larger. This means that if we want our programs and algorithms to be scalable with large amounts of data or inputs without dramatically increasing their runtimes then they should have good Big O scores; meaning they are fast even at high input sizes! 

To ensure your code has good BigO scores there are several best practices you can follow:

 - Break down complex tasks into smaller ones: By breaking down complex operations into smaller chunks which take less time each on average will help reduce overall runtime in larger datasets as these small tasks add up quickly when dealing with lots of data!

 - Use optimized data structures & search methods: Using efficient ways such as hash tables instead of linear searches will drastically reduce run times in certain scenarios so make sure your choosing appropriate methods based on what type/size dataset you're working with here too!

 - Avoid unnecessary calculations & redundant work: If something isn't needed don't do it! Unnecessary calculations slow things down so avoid doing extra work where possible by only calculating what needs done instead; this also applies if multiple pieces need same calculation but don't store them redundantly either just reference one result from memory later on if needed again elsewhere within same function call etc..  

Following these tips should allow anyone writing code a chance at achieving great big o scores while still keeping their programs readable and easy-to-maintain over time too. Good luck out there coding everyone!!
